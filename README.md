> Extract critical CSS and inline it in `<style>`-Tag



## Getting Started
This plugin requires Grunt `>=0.4.5`

If you haven't used [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) before, be sure to check out the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide, as it explains how to create a [Gruntfile](http://gruntjs.com/sample-gruntfile) as well as install and use Grunt plugins. Once you're familiar with that process, you may install this plugin with this command:

```shell
npm install grunt-criticalcss-inline --save-dev
```

Once the plugin has been installed, it may be enabled inside your Gruntfile with this line of JavaScript:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-criticalcss-inline');
```

**Issues with the output should be reported on the criticalcss-inline [issue tracker](https://github.com/saschazar21/grunt-criticalcss-inline/issues).**

## Critical-Inline Task
